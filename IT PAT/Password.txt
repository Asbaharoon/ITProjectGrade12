Forgetting your Password

You may access the 'Forgot Password' screen by 
using the label on the login page. Upon clicking this label,
you will be shown the screen. The screen will allow you to
enter your current username and click 'Search' so as to find your security
question and its answer. Should the system not find your 
username, then you will need to retype it. Once your username
is found, the field where you can enter your answer will be 
enabled and the search button as well as the usernamne field will
be disabled. Your question will be displayed and you will then enter
your answer and click 'Enter'. If correct, you will be able to enter your
new desired password and click 'Enter' to change your password. The screen
will close after your password has been changed and the login page
will be opened
