Vision
To create and provide an ideal environment with the best possible facilities 
for children from all walks of life, recognizing and developing the unique 
potential of each individual so that they can take their place in any 
international tertiary institution and in the world of work.

Mission
Whilst recognizing the unique potential of each individual, we will 
provide an educational environment in which children from diverse 
backgrounds can grow together. We will facilitate an innovative, yet 
pragmatic, approach which is essential in order to equip our pupils with 
the necessary skills, knowledge and attitudes which will enable them 
to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world. We will produce 
young adults who will be independent thinkers with physical and 
moral courage, who are articulate, well-mannered and educated in 
the widest sense, with sensitivity to the needs of others.
