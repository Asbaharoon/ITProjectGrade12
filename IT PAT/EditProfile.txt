Editing Your Profile

In the main menu screen, there is an 'Edit Profile' button.
Upon clicking this button, the screen that will allow
you to edit your profile will appear and the main menu
will close. You may edit any of your data on this screen and
click 'Update' when you are satisfied. The system will
notify you of any errors in the data you would have entered
and you will be required to fix them before proceeding. 
Upon clicking 'Update', you will be able to edit your security question
should you feel the need to. If you inform the system that you want 
to edit the question, you will also be required to enter a new answer
as well. Upon completing this process,  the screen will close and
you will be directed to the main menu.
