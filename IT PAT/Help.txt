Using The Help Screen

The help screen is available to you throughout the program 
and can be accessed at any time. The opening of this screen 
will not close the screen you opened it over and you may 
close the help screen by clicking the 'Return' button provided. 
The screen has different buttons that you can use to obtain 
explanations regarding different funtions of the program as 
well as why different fuctions exist. Upon clicking any of 
the buttons on the screen (excluding the return button), 
a corresponding explanation will appear in the text area in 
the center of the screen just as this text appears now. 
You MAY NOT edit any text that is presented to you and 
should you do so and wish to restore it, click the button again. 
If text is edited on this screen, the content of the text files 
storing the explanations will not be affected.
